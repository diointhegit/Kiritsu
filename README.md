# Kiritsu (規律)
## Description 
This will be a cross-platform app created with Next.JS and React Native, using Tailwind (NativeWind) and Redis

## Why Kiritsu?
Kiritsu means Discipline (or stand up). The idea behind this app is making me and everyone who needs to relearn discipline be able to commit to their projects, studies, works and everything they lack discipline in.
The name was chosen randomly, i really like to think about the idea, and throwing into google translate until i find a name that sounds good.

Also this project will be open source.
The skills i'll try to improve with this projects are:
1 - Learn Redis
2 - How to use monorepos (my first time, and first time using Turbo, i'm really excited)
3 - UI/UX design
4 - Design thinking skills
5 - Project organization. 
6 - Cross Platform projects
7 - Last, but not least, i'll improve even more, my favourite skill. The web development with React and Typescript



This projects is being created as of 25/02/2025
The last edition to this README.md is: 25/02/2025
